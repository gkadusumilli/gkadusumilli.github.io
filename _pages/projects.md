The GDELT Project monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes ...in the entire world. With new files uploaded every 15 minutes, GDELT data bases contain more than 500 Gb of zipped data for the single year 2018.

In a group project, we worked on a resilient No-SQL (Cassandra) database architecture on EC2 instances. The pipeline for the data processing was developped in Spark-Scala. The visualization implied Zeppelin Notebooks.

# Deep Learning : Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (Text, Sound, Video)

In this research project in partnership with the French Employment Agency, we explored state of the art models in multimodal sentiment analysis. We have chosen to explore textual, sound and video inputs, and predict emotions / psychological traits associated to each modality. We developped a Flask web app that gathers all this information, and presents a visualization of the performance of the person.
