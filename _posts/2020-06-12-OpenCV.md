In this blog post we will learn fundamental OpenCV functions required for image manipulation tasks. let us dive in....

## Image
Image is an array or a matrix of square pixels (picture elements) arranged in columns and rows.

#### Key terms and types of images

**Pixel**: Pixels are building blocks of an image. In other words,  a pixel is the smallest possible image that can be depicted on the screen.

**Binary image**: An image that consists of only black & white pixels

**Grayscale image**: It contains intensity values ranging from a minimum (depicting absolute black) to a maximum (depicting absolute white) and is in between varying shades of gray. Typically, this range is between o & 255.

**Color image**: The image is composed of three primary colors, Red, Green, Blue. Hence also called an RGB image.

**RGB Value**: All colors we can see around us can be made by adding red, blue, green components in varying proportions.


## 1. Reading, Writing images

```python
import cv2
image = cv2.imread('pic.jpg')
cv2.imwrite('output.jpg',image)
```
